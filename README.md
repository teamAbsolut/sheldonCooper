This is CHALLENGE 1 codename sheldonCooper
==========================================

-n Sheldon Cooper, B.S., M.S., M.A., Ph.D., Sc.D. is a character in the awesome show The Big Bang Theory. He's known to be super geeky and to correct people's mistakes.
Now, you can too!

Challenge Description
---------------------

This challenge is the first of hopefully many to come. What you are required to do is create an awesome class called SheldonCooper. The point of this class is to behave like a spell check. It must implement a method called correctorizor that accepts a string that may or may not be a correct word. The output of this method is an array of around 5 length that contains the "most correct alternatives" of that error.
Something that may be of use is the file under `/usr/dict/words` or `/usr/share/dict` or `/usr/share/words/dict` or something to that effect that contains the dictionary we will be using.
Realistically, anybody partaking in this challenge can just look up spellcheck algorithms but the point here is to try and create your own. It's more of a fun exercise with a competitive spin.
That being said, I have no idea how to judge this, we'll work on that later.

How to Participate
